# Netflix Clone Deployment
Netflix clone using various tools and technologies. Jenkins will serve as the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) tool, and the application will be deployed within a Docker container, managed within a Kubernetes Cluster. Additionally, for monitor Jenkins and Kubernetes metrics using Grafana, Prometheus, and Node exporter.

## Steps

### Step 1: Launch an Ubuntu(22.04) T2 Large Instance

- Start by launching an Ubuntu 22.04 T2 Large instance on preferred cloud provider.

### Step 2: Install Jenkins, Docker, and Trivy. Create a Sonarqube Container using Docker.

- Install Jenkins, Docker, and Trivy on your server.
- Create a Sonarqube container using Docker.

### Step 3: Create a TMDB API Key

- Obtain a TMDB API Key for accessing movie data.

### Step 4: Install Prometheus and Grafana On the new Server

- Install Prometheus and Grafana on your server for monitoring.

### Step 5: Install the Prometheus Plugin and Integrate it with the Prometheus server

- Set up Prometheus plugin and integrate it with your Prometheus server for metrics collection.

### Step 6: Email Integration With Jenkins and Plugin setup

- Configure email integration with Jenkins and set up necessary plugins.

### Step 7: Install Plugins like JDK, Sonarqube Scanner, Node.js, and OWASP Dependency Check

- Install required plugins such as JDK, Sonarqube Scanner, Node.js, and OWASP Dependency Check in Jenkins.

### Step 8: Create a Pipeline Project in Jenkins using a Declarative Pipeline

- Create a pipeline project in Jenkins using a declarative pipeline to automate your deployment.

### Step 9: Install OWASP Dependency Check Plugins

- Install OWASP Dependency Check plugins for security scanning.

### Step 10: Docker Image Build and Push

- Build and push Docker images for your application.

### Step 11: Deploy the image using Docker

- Deploy the Docker image of your application.

### Step 12: Kubernetes master and slave setup on Ubuntu (20.04)

- Set up a Kubernetes master and slave on Ubuntu 20.04 for scalable deployment.

### Step 13: Access the Netflix app on the Browser

- Access your Netflix clone application through a web browser.

### Step 14: Terminate the AWS EC2 Instances

- Terminate the AWS EC2 instances to save resources.


## let's get started and dig deeper into each of these steps:

## Step 1: Launch an Ubuntu(22.04) T2 Large Instance

Launch an AWS T2 Large Instance, using the Ubuntu image. You have the option to either create a new key pair or use an existing one. For the purpose of learning, enable HTTP and HTTPS settings in the security group and open all ports

## Step 2: Install Jenkins, Docker, and Trivy

### 2A: To Install Jenkins

Connect to your console, and enter these commands to Install Jenkins

```
vi jenkins.sh #make sure run in Root (or) add at userdata while ec2 launch
```

```
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update -y
#sudo apt upgrade -y
wget -O - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc] https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install temurin-17-jdk -y
/usr/bin/java --version
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
                  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
                  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
                              /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

```
sudo chmod 777 jenkins.sh
./jenkins.sh    # installl jenkins
```

## Configuring Jenkins After Installation

Once Jenkins is installed, follow these steps:

1. **Open Port 8080**: To access Jenkins, you need to open inbound traffic on port 8080 in your AWS EC2 Security Group. Ensure that the necessary security group rules are in place to allow incoming connections to Jenkins, as it operates on port 8080.

2. **Obtain Your Public IP Address**: server's Public IP address to access the Jenkins web interface. we can find this by checking your AWS EC2 instance details or by using a service like [WhatIsMyIP](https://www.whatismyip.com/).
access Jenkins using your Public IP address and port 8080.

```
<EC2 Public IP Address:8080>
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Unlock Jenkins: Use the provided administrative password to unlock Jenkins during installation.
Install Plugins: Jenkins will install the necessary plugins automatically.
User Creation: Create a user, save, and continue.
Jenkins Getting Started: You'll now see the Jenkins Getting Started screen.

### 2A: Install Docker

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   #my ubuntu
newgrp docker
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
```
![docker](screenshots/docker-install.png)
After installing Docker, proceed to create a Sonarqube container. Remember to add port 9000 to the security group rules.

```
docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community
```
![docker-sonar](screenshots/docker-sonarimage.png)

Now our sonarqube is up and running

Enter username and password, click on login and change password
```
username admin
password admin

### 2A â€” Install Trivy

```
vi trivy.sh
```
```
sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release -y
wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg] https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install trivy -y
```
